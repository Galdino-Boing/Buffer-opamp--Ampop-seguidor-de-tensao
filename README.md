# opamp-ampop
This project explores the versatility of operational amplifiers (Op-Amps) in various configurations, such as inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, with the goal of studying and applying different signal amplification techniques. Using Op-Amps creatively, the project involves the construction and analysis of amplifier circuits
